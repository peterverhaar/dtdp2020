    "A computer program is essentially an implementation of one or more algorithms. Algorithms, in turn, consist of descriptions of the concrete steps that need to be followed to arrive at a specific result. Computer programs translate these steps or activities into concrete instructions or commands. These instructions can be referred to, more generally, as statements. In the Python language, the individual statements are delineated by hard returns. The end of the statement (i.e. the hard return) is a cue which triggers the Python parser to interpret and to execute the statement. \n",

    "## Printing output\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are generally written to solve specific problems, and they usually produce some output. This output can be the result of a calculation, for instance. The print() function can be used to communicate the output of the program to the user. As will be explained in more detail later, a function is a named collection of statements. The print() function is always used with parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you can provide the text that you would like the computer to display. This text must be provided either in single or in double quotes."

    "\n",
    "Virtually all programming languages make use of variables of some sort. Variables can be thought of as containers or as boxes in which information can be stored temporarily. Variables are always given a name. This name can be used to retrieve the 'contents' of the variable. These contents (the data referred to by the variable) is generally referred to as the variable's *value*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables names can consist of any combination of alphanumerical characters that you can think of. Underscores are also allowed in variable names. One important rule, however, is that variable names cannot begin with a number and they cannot contain spaces. Although it is possible to work with any sequence of characters, your script will evidently be most understandable when you make use of variable names which are meaningful. Note that there are a number of reserved words which have a particular function in the Python language, and which cannot be used as variable names for this reason. The list of reserved words include ‘for’, ‘in’, ‘is’, ‘print’, ‘global’, ‘def’, ‘if, ‘elif’ and ‘else’. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, variables can be given a value. The act of giving a value to a certain variable is called *assignment*. In the first example, the variable named placeName is assigned the value ‘Leiden’. "

Strings can be created either with single quotes or with double quotes. The variable 'numberofInhabitants' is an example of an integer (i.e. a natural number). Next to such integers, Python can also work with rational numbers. They are called floats or floating point numbers. Unlike strings, numbers are not surrounded by quotes. "
