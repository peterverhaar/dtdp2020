This can be the case when you want to print a longer sentence discussing the results of a calculation, such as “5 plus 7 is 12”. If this is the sentence that you want to print, the integers in this sentence need to be converted into strings first, via the str() function. It may be accomplished as follows:\n"

    "Having to convert all integers to strings may be slightly cumbersome. An alternative solution is to make use of the format() method. It is a method which can convert any type of variable into a string. To use it, you need to append the name of the method to the string that you want to print. Within the parentheses, you need to mention all the variables whose values you want to print. Additionally, the string that you want to print needs to contain so-called placeholders, on the locations where the values of these variables should appear. These placeholders take the form of an empty set of curly brackets. The number of placeholders needs to be exactly the same as the number of variables mentioned in the format function. The format() returns a formatted string, with all variables simply inserted into the string, on the locations indicated by the placeholders. "

In Python, you can specify the number of times a set of statements are repeated by making use of ‘while’ or ‘for’. As is the case for ‘if’, the ‘while’ keyword should be followed by a test, or, more precisely, by a Boolean expression. The ‘while’ keyword initiates a loop. The statements that follow ‘while’ will be repeated as long as the expression is true. Clearly, it is necessary to ensure that the expression can also be evaluated to ‘false’ at some point, since the repetition will otherwise continue endlessly. The variable that can end the loop is called the iteration value. \n",

When you use range( 1, 11 ), for instance, this results in a list of integers ranging from 1 up and until 10. The line ‘for i in range( 1 , 11 )’, in the code below, starts a sequence of 10 loops.
