    "Using the output of this print command, we can get an impression of what pandas has done with the CSV file. The data frame that is created when you run the read_csv() method consist of a collection of rows and of columns. As can be seen in the ouput, the rows are all assigned numbers. These numbers are referred to as ‘indices’ (the plural form of ‘index’). Additionally, the columns have all been given a name. These names have been copied form the header of the CSV file. The header is typically on the very first line of the CSV file. In the sample CSV file shown above, you can see that the first line consists of a number of strings, delimited by commas. Following the execution of the `read_csv()` method, these separate strings all become available as column names. Pandas represents the missing value in column E of the row with index 5 using the code `NaN`, which stands for ‘Not a number’. If a column contains a 'Nan' value, all the other numbers in this column will be shown as float values.\n",

More specifically, this means that we create new data frame, by copying only some of the columns that are available in another data frame. The easiest way to accomplish this is by supplying a list of the column names that you want to keep within the square brackets appended to data frame that needs to be filtered. After running the code below, the data frame named `new_df` has the exact same number of rows as df, but it only contains three of its columns. "
