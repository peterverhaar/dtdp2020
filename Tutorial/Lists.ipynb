    "The variables that were discussed in the tutorial on Python basics were all assigned single values, such as strings, integers or floating point numbers. Alternatively, it is also possible to work with variables that contain collections of values. One example of a variable type that can hold multiple values is the list. Lists can be created by surrounding all the values that you want to gather by square brackets. The individual values within such lists need to be separated by commas. The statement below creates a list containing the five days of the working week:\n"

    "When lists are created in this manner, Python numbers the elements in the array automatically, following the order in which these values given. These numbers will function as indices that can be used to access the individual items in the array. Bear in mind that Python starts counting at 0. In the example above, the element “Monday” is assigned the index “0”, and the element “Thursday” will have the index “3”. As is the case for strings and their individual characters, the separate elements in the list can be accessed using the bracket operator. \n",
