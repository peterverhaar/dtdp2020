    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of research in computer science and in computational linguistics which aims to make computers understand natural languages as spoken by human beings. Researchers in the field of NLP have developd sophisticated tools for the recognition of grammatical and syntactic categories, or for the conversion of inflected word forms into their dictionary forms, among many other purposes. Current more advanced research focuses the development of software for tasks such as named entity recognition, machine translation, or unsupervised summarisation. Tasks such as these all demand an understanding not only of the grammar and the syntax, but also of the logical structure and the semantic contents of the text.\n",

The nltk method `word_tokenize()` can be used to tokenise a text into words. The method `sent_tokenize()` can divide a text into sentences. Listing 5.1 contains an illustration of how these methods can be used."

Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lemmatisation is a process in which the conjugated forms of the words that are found in a text are converted to their base dictionary form. This base form is referred to as the lemma. English verbs can be used, for instance, in the past tense, in the present tense, in the continuous form or in the perfect form, and these different forms can evidently make it more difficult to search systematically for occurrences of a specific verb. In this context, lemmatization can offer a solution. In many cases, the manner in which words are to be lemmatised depends on their contexts. Certain homonyms may either be verbs or nouns, for instance, and, depending on their usage, they should be lemmatised to different forms. To solve issues such as these, the lemmatiser that was built as part of the nltk library can be used in combination with POS tags. The `lemmatize()` method, inside the `WordNetLemmatizer` module, demands two parameters: the word to be lemmatised and the (simplified) POS tag of the word, given the linguistic context of the word. Listing 5.3 demonstrates how the method can be used.\n"
