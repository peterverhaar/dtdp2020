A random-matrix  formula  is derived for the  variance of an  arbitrary  linear statistic on the  trans-
mission  eigenvalues.  The  variance  is  independent  of  the  eigenvalue  density  and  has  a  universal
dependence  on  the  symmetry  of the  matrix  ensemble.  The  formula  generalizes  the  Dyson-Mehta
theorem  in the  statistical theory  of energy levels.  It  demonstrates  that  the  Universality  of the con-
ductance  fluctuations  is generic for a whole class of transport  properties in mesoscopic Systems.

In  the  sixties,  Wigner,  Dyson,  Mehta,  and  others de-
veloped  random-matrix  theory  (RMT)  into  a  powerful
tool  to  study  the  statistics of energy  levels  measured  in
nuclear  reactions  [1,2].  It  was shown  that  the  fluctua-
tions  in  the  energy  level  density  are  governed  by  level
repulsion,  which depends on the  symmetry of the  Hamil-
tonian  ensemble—but  is  independent  of the  mean  level
density  [3-6].  This  Universality  is  at  the  origin  of  the
remarkable success of RMT  in nuclear physics.  The  uni-
versality of the  level  fluctuations  is expressed by the  cel-
ebrated  Dyson-Mehta  formula  [7] for  the  variance  of  a
linear  statistic  A  = Σηα(Εη)  on the energy  levels  En.
[The  quantity  A  is  called  a linear statistic  because  prod-
ucts  of different  En  do not appear,  but  the  function  a(E)
may  well  depend  nonlinearly on  E.]  The  Dyson-Mehta
formula  reads

where  a(k)  =  J^^dE  elkBa(E)  is the  Fourier  transform
of  a(E),  and  β  =  1,2,  or  4  depending  on  whether  the
Hamiltonian ensemble belongs to the orthogonal, unitary,
or  symplectic symmetry  class.  Equation  (1)  shows  that
(1)  the  variance  is  independent  of  microscopic parame-
ters;  and (2) the variance has a universal  l/β  dependence
on  the  symmetry  parameter  of the  ensemble.

In  a  seminal  1986  paper  [8],  Imry  proposed  to  apply
RMT  to  the  phenomenon of  universal  conductance  fluc-
tuations  (UCF), which was  discovered  diagrammatically
by  Al'tshuler  [9] and  Lee  and  Stone  [10].  Shortly  after-
wards,  a  RMi  of  quantum  transport  was  developed  by
Muttalib, Pichard, and Stone  [11].  In this  theory the  role
of  the  energy  levels  is  played  by  the  transmission  eigen-
values Tn, or more precisely  by the ratio \n =  (l—Tn}/Tn
of  reflection  and  transmission  coefficients.  Their  work  is
reviewed  in Ref.  [12], together  with  a  closely  related  the-
ory  due  to  Mello,  Pereyra,  and  Kumar  [13].  (For  still
another  approach,  see  Ref.  [14].)  Good  agreement  was
obtained  with  the  diagrammatic  theory  of  UCF. How-
ever,  it  could  not  be  shown  that  the  Universality  of  the
fluctuations  is  generic  for  arbitrary  linear  statistics  on
the  transmission  eigenvalues.  In  particular,  no formula

with  the  generality  of  the  Dyson-Mehta  theorem  could
be  derived.  The  lack  of  such  a  general  theory  is  being
feit  especially  now that  mesoscopic  fluctuations  in trans-
port  properties  other  than  the  conductance  (both in con-
ductors  and  superconductors)  have  become  of  interest
[15-17].  The  obstacle  which  prevents  a  straightforward
generalization  of  the  Dyson-Mehta  formula  was  clearly
identified  by  Stone  et  al.  [12]:  The  correlation  functions
in  the  RMT  of  quantum  transport  are  not  translation-
ally invariant,  due to the  positivity  constraint  on λ.  This
constraint  λ  >  0  follows  directly  from  unitarity  of  the
scattering  matrix.  In contrast,  the  correlation  functions
in the  RMT  of energy  levels  are  translationally  invariant
over  the  energy  ränge of interest.

Here  we wish  to  announce  that  one can overcome  this
obstacle towards the  establishment of Universality  in  the
random-matrix theory of quantum transport.

The  starting  point  of  our  analysis  is  the  probability

(1)

distribution  [11]

P({Xn})  = Z'1  exp[-ß-H({Xn}}],

(2)

i<3

where  Z  is  a  normalization  constant.  The  variables  Xn
(n  = l, 2, . . . N)  are related to the transmission  eigenval-
ues Tn by Tn  — (l + A„)~1.  The T„ are the eigenvalues of
the matrix product  ttf  , where t is the NxN  transmission
matrix of the  conductor  (N  being  the  number of scatter-
ing  channels).  Since  λ  is  in  one-to-one  correspondence
with  T,  we  will  call  the  λ  also  transmission  eigenvalues.
As  mentioned,  Xn  > 0 because  0 < Tn  < 1.  The param-
eter  β  equals  2  if  time-reversal  symmetry  is  broken  (by
a  magnetic  field).  Otherwise,  β  equals  l  in the  absence
and  4  in  the  presence of  strong  spin-orbit  scattering.

The  probability  distribution  (2)  has  the  form  of  a
Gibbs distribution, with the symmetry  parameter  β  play-
ing  the  role  of  inverse  temperature,  and  the  "Hamilto-
nian"  Ή  containing  a  logarithmic  repulsive  interaction
plus a confining  potential  V.  The function  V (λ) is chosen
such  that  P  yields  the  required  average  eigenvalue den-
sity  (which  depends  on the  sample  size  and  the  degree

of  disorder).  Note that  V  may  be  also  a  function  of  ß.
The logarithmic interaction has a fundamental  geometric
origin: It is the  Jacobian associated with the  transforma-
tion  from  the  space  of scattering  (or  transfer)  matrices
to  the  smaller  space of transmission  eigenvalues  [11-13].
The  form  (2) for the  probability distribution  is based  on
(a)  an  isotropy  assumption,  which  implies  that  flux  in-
cident  in  one  scattering  channel  is,  on  average,  equally
distributed among all outgoing channels; and  (b) a  max-
imum  entropy  hypothesis,  which  yields  (2)  äs  the  least
restrictive  distribution  consistent  with  a  given  average
eigenvalue  density.  Assumption  (a) requires a  conductor
much  longer  than  wide,  i.e.,  the  quasi-one-dimensional
limit.  Assumption  (b)  has  been  justified  by  compari-
son with  numerical simulations  [11,12],  but  there exists
no  rigorous  proof.  Indeed, it  is conceivable that  the  true
eigenvalue  distribution P({Xn})  cannot be fully described
by  a  one-body  potential  V(X)  plus  Jacobian,  äs  in  Eq.
(2),  but  that  it  contains  additional  many-body  poten-
tials.  These would  modify  the  logarithmic interaction of
the  λ.  We emphasize this  because one of the implications
of our  analysis  will be that  Eq.  (2) is  not  rigorously  valid
—  although  the  error  is quite  small.

We  consider an observable  A  which is a linear  statistic

on  the  λ,  i.e.,

N

n=l

(5)

To  find  the  variance  va,rA  =  (A2)  — (A)2  we  need  the
two-point  correlation  function  K2(X,  λ'),  defined  by

Here  p(X)  =  Χ)η<$(λ  — λη)  is  the  microscopic eigenvalue
density,  and the  brackets  (· · ·) indicate  the  average with
distribution  P({Xn}).  The  mean  density  is

(6)

Our method is to relate the correlation function  to a  func-
tional derivative  of the  eigenvalue density  with  respect  to
V,  and  then  to  evaluate  this  functional  derivative  in  the
limit  N  —>  oo.  A  similar  line  of  reasoning  was  used  by
Politzer  [18], for a different  purpose  (viz., to show that  A
has  a  Gaussian  distribution).  We  discuss  the  two  steps
of  our  method  separately.

(1)  The  functional  derivative  of  (p(X))  with  respect
to  V(Ä')  consists  of  two  terms:  Differentiation  of
the  numerator  in  Eq.  (5)  gives  —ß(p(X)p(X')), 
since
6H/6V(X)  =  p(X).  Differentiation  of  the  denominator
gives  ß(p(X))(p(X')). 

The  two terms together  yield

Substitution  into Eq.  (6) then  gives

(8)

This relationship between the variance of a linear statistic
and  the  functional  derivative of the  density of transmis-
sion  eigenvalues is an  exact  consequence of the  probabil-
ity  distribution  (2).

(2)  To  evaluate  the  functional  derivative  (7)  we  must
know  how the  density of transmission eigenvalues  (p) de-
pends on the  potential  V  in the  Hamiltonian  (2).  There
exists a one-to-one relationship between these two  quan-
tities,  because  V  is assumed to  be a one-body potential.
For large N  the  relationship is given  by the  integral equa-
tion  [4, 19]

άλ'  (p(X'))  In |λ -  λ'  +

= V  + c.

(9)

Ja

The  constant  c  is  to  be  determined  from  the normaliza-
tion  condition  /  dX  (p)  — N.  The  second  term  on  the
left-hand  side  of  Eq.  (9)  is  of  order  ./V"1  In N  relative  to
the  first,  and  terms  of  still  higher  order  in  l/N  are  ne-
glected.  To  calculate  the  two-point  correlation  function
(7)  in leading  order  it  is  sufficient  to  retain  only the  first
term,  so that  we  can work  with  the  linear  integral  equa-
tion

dX'  (p(X'))  In |λ -  λ'| = V(A) + c.

(10)

Equation  (10)  has  the  intuitive  "mean-field"  Interpreta-
tion  (originally due to Wigner) that the  "charge  density"
(p)  adjusts  itself  to  the  "'external  potential"  V  in  such  a
way  that  the  total  force  on  any  charge  λ  vanishes  [12].
The  more  accurate  Eq.  (9)  shows  that,  in  fact,  Eq.  (10)
is  the  leading  term  in a l /N  expansion.

Equations  (8)  and  (10)  have  two  immediate  implica-
tions  for the  universality  of the variance  of a linear  statis-
tic  on  the  transmission  eigenvalues:  (1)  Equation  (10)
is  a  linear  relation  between  (p)  and  V,  and  hence  the
functional  derivative  S(p)/6V 
is  independent  of  V,  Since
all  microscopic parameters  enter  via  the  potential  V(X),
this  implies that  the  variance  (8)  is  independent  of  mi-
croscopic  parameters. 
(2)  The  kernel  in  Eq.  (10)  does
not  contain ß, and  hence  the  variance  (8) has a  universal
l/β  dependence  on the  symmetry  parameter.  This con-
clusion  holds  irrespective  of  any  ß  dependence  of  V (λ).
If  one  is  only  interested  in  the  universality  of  the  meso-
scopic  fluctuations,  one  can  stop  here.  To  calculate  the
numerical value of var A  requires a  little more work.  The
integral  equation  (10)  can  be  solved  by  Meilin  transfor-
mation, which yields the  functional derivative  δ (p) /6V  äs
the  solving  kernel.  Here  we only  give  the  results;  math-
ematical details of the  calculation  will be  published  else-
where  [20].

The  kernel  in  Eq.  (14)  is  the  Fourier  transform  with  re-
spect  to  χ  — x'  of  KI(X,X').  Equation  (14) is  for  the
quantum  transport  problem what  the  Dyson-Mehta for-
mula  (1) was  for  the  statistics  of energy  levels.

As  an  independent  check of the  validity  of our  key  re-
sult, we have compared  Eq.  (14) with an exactly  solvable
model.  This is the  Laguerre ensemble, defined  by  Eq. (2)
with  β  =  2  and  V(X)  =  %X  -  ^αΐηλ.  The  parameter
a  >  — l  is arbitrary.  The correlation  function  for this en-
semble is known exactly,  in terms  of generalized  Laguerre
polynomials  [12, 22].  In Fig.  l  we  show  the  comparison
for  the  variance  of  the  conductance.  The  conductance
G  is  a  linear  statistic  on  the  transmission  eigenvalues,
according  to  the  Landauer  formula

For  the  Laguerre  ensemble  (which  has  β  =  2)  we  would

FIG.  1.  Variance  of the  conductance  G  (in units  of Go =
2e2/h)  äs a function  of the  number  of channels N.  The  data
points  are  obtained  by  Integration  of  the  exact  correlation
function  for  the  generalized  Laguerre  ensemble  [12, 22], for
various values of the microscopic parameter  a.  The  estimated
error  in the  numerical Integration  is ±0.001.  (For a  =  —0.5
we could  only integrate  with  the  required  accuracy  for N  up
to  25.)  The  horizontal  line  at  0.0625 is  the  α  independent
value predicted  in  the  limit  N  —> oo  by  Eq. (14).

parameter).  As  one can see in Fig.  l, this  is indeed  what
we  find  (within  numerical  accuracy)  from  Integration  of
the  exact  correlation  function.

The  coefficient |  in Eq. (17) is  close to but not  pre-

cisely identical to the established value ^ for a quasi-one-
dimensional  conductor  [10,23].  The  smallness of the dif-
ference  explains  why  it was  not noticed  previously.  From
a practical  point of view, the difference  is not really signif-
icant,  but  conceptually  it  has  the  important  implication
that  the  RMT based  on the  probability  distribution  (2)
is  not  rigorously  equivalent  to  the  diagrammatic  theory
of  UCF  [24],  which  we  hold  to  be  exact.  The  conclu-
sion is that the interaction  between  the λ  is not  precisely
logarithmic.

The  variance  formula  (14) can  be  readily  applied  to
other  transport  properties  which are linear  statistics.  As
an  Illustration,  we  briefly  discuss  some  examples  which
have  previously  been  studied  by  other  methods  [15-17].
The  first  example  is  the  shot-noise  power  P  of a  phase-
coherent  conductor, given  by  [25]

Here  P0  =  2e|C/|G0,  with  U  the  applied  voltage.  The
variance  formula  (14)  yields  var  (P/  PO)  =  eiß~1·  The
second  example  is the  conductance  GN$ of a  disordered
microbridge  between  a normal  (N) and  a  superconduct-
ing  (S)  reservoir,  which  is  related  to  the  transmission
eigenvalues in the  normal state by [26]

This expression  holds only in zero magnetic field and for
spin-independent  scattering,  i.e., for  β  =  1.  Applying

Eq.  (14)  we  obtain  var(GNs/Go)  =  ^,  where  we  have
set  β  equal  to  1.  For broken  time-reversal symmetry  the
conductance  of  the  NS junction  is  not  a  linear  statistic
[26];  hence  no  l/β  dependence  of  the  variance  is  to  be
expected.  The  third  example  is  the  supercurrent  phase
relationship  Ι(φ]  of  a  point-contact  Josephson  junction,
which  for β  = l  is  given  by  [15]

Δ  being the  energy  gap  in the  bulk  superconductor.  Ap-
plication  of the  variance formula  (14)  to  the  linear  statis-
tic  (20)  yields  a  rms  value  which  increases  linearly  at
small  φ and  saturates  at  rms/(π)  = π"1 βΔ/ft  äs  φ ap-
proaches  π.  For  the  critical  current  Ic  =  max/(<?!>)  we
find  [27]  rms Ic  = 0.29  βΔ/ft.

We have checked  for all these transport  properties that
the variances predicted by Eq.  (14)  agree with the  numer-
ical  results  from  the  Laguerre  ensemble.

In conclusion, we have derived the  analog of the  Dyson-
Mehta  theorem  [7] for  the  quantum  transport  problem.
The formula  obtained  demonstrates that the  universality
which  was  the  hallmark  of  the  phenomenon  of  "univer-
sal  conductance  fluctuations"  [9,10]  is  generic  for  linear
statistics  on  the  transmission  eigenvalues.  This  univer-
sality was  anticipated  [8]  from  the  random-matrix theory
of  energy  levels,  but  could  not  previously  be  established
because  of  the  absence  of  translational  invariance  of  the
correlation  function  of transmission  coefficients  (originat-
ing  from  the  unitarity  of  the  scattering  matrix)  [12].  Fi-
nally, our analysis has revealed a small but  real  numerical
discrepancy  between  the  random-matrix  theory  [l 1] and
the  diagrammatic  calculation  [9,10],  which  implies  that
the  interaction  between  the  λ  eigenvalues  is  not  precisely
logarithmic.

[21]  Equation  (13)  requires that α(λ) be  differentiable.  In par-
ticular, var A  diverges  logarithmically for a step  function,
α (λ)  = 9(\c  — λ).  For such  artificial  linear  statistics  the
variance  does  not  have  a  universal  N  —>  oo  limit,  but
increases  äs  In N  for  large 7V [7].  All physical properties,
however,  are  smooth  (differentiable)  functions  of  λ.

Τ·2  considered  in  this  reference  is  related  to  the  "two-
point  correlation  function"  KZ  of  the  present  paper  by
Κ2(λ,  λ') = Γ2(λ, λ') -  (ρ(λ))<5(λ -  λ').

Muttalib,  Pichard,  and  Stone  [11] (the  so-called  "global
approach")  is  not  precisely  equivalent  to  the  "local  ap-
proacä''  of  Mello  et  al.  [13, 23].  Previous  work  by  Mello
and  Pichard  [Phys.  Rev.  B  40,  5276  (1989)]  argues  for
(he  equivalence  of the two theories. Their argument  starts
from  a  one-body  potential  V(X),  i.e., it  assumes that  the
interaction  between  the  λ  is  precisely  logarithmic. We
now  know that  this  is  an approximation (albeit  an excel-
lent one).

[27]  We  have  used that  for  7V  —>  oo, var/c  =  var/(<)i>c),  where
